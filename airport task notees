# create weather class and require it 
# we create a separate weather class because can an Airport control or show weather? 
# Classes should reflect real life so a seprate class for weather is needed 
# the Airport class needs to know about the weather class for it to use its methods so you use require to link the file 


#I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
# Most cases you use a CONSTANT when you do not want the value to change 
#Â in this case sometimes we may want to change the value so it it better to make capacity into an instance variable 
#CAPACITY = 5 # Capacity for 5 planes can be changed instead of writing the number everywhere


class Airport
  def intialize(weather = Weather.new, capacity = 10 #adding 10 here sets a defualt value if equaled to itself then you must give it an argument later on
  # when used)
 # @weather = weather
   @capacity = capacity #this now includes cthe capacity from above which contains a defualt value 
  #end 
  #I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport
  def land_plane
    return "Plane landed"

  #from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport
